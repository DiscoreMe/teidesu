### Brief
- Me is **Max** aka `teidesu`
- Fullstack **js/ts** dev, student, weeb and part-time anime girl based in Moscow
- Enjoy building cool things, discovering, inventing and analysing different protocols and algorithms
- Would **LOVE** to join your interesting and aspiring project (but not looking for official jobs yet)
- Currently exploring AI & ML, WebGL and VR

### My projects
#### Most of my time I currently spend working on
 - [PlaShiki](//github.com/plashiki), which is an open-source anime video aggregator
 - **???**, which is a large project and I'm not yet ready to elaborate on it 
 - and nothing else at the moment.

#### I also made these open-source thingies
 - [protoflex](//github.com/teidesu/protoflex), which is a JS tool for parsing and building arbitrary [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) messages.
 - [vk-audio](//gist.github.com/teidesu/09ff9fe13814f3cd1fe93203447890d9), which is a JS script that produces [VK](//vk.com) tokens valid for usage with restricted `audio.*` API methods
 - [ym_recognition](//gist.github.com/teidesu/7ddf9e0fd89872b09d28d8f59077f2b1), which is a Python script that (ab)uses Yandex Alice to recognize music (poor man's Shazam)
 - [sourcemap-extractor.js](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/a0648a1f380fb91f9324c90033b61831), which is a JS script that loads and extracts original code from JS source maps
 - [tg-stickers-downloader.js](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/74f75f1119ba2e6e566afdff084050bb), which is a JS script that downloads sticker packs from Telegram using Bot API
 - [bencode.js](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/a1eadf71ffd88166415e2ea8b94d3f3b), which is a small JS library for bEncode (used in .torrent files)
 - [torrent-to-magnet.ts](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/442052ac3e4495447192cab0bfceb384), which is a small JS script/library that converts .torrent files to magnet: links

#### And these open-source utility functions/classes
 - [desu_wrapper.py](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/2021c9cc51d4eefe23d3e7f81be38139), which is a simple Python wrapper over ugly sqlite3 which is thread-safe, supports simple migrations and has a bit cleaner API
 - [linked-list.js](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/5ff61bf65724c7fcd20d6beaf015b9e4), which is a simple implementation of a linked list in JS
 - [debug.ts](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/0c1348ed64df52d0a6d1868fef3e08c9), which is a TS wrapper for JS library `debug`
 - [base32.js](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/1c0213ba127086390e2de7655f941ada), which is a small JS library for Base32 using NodeJS Buffers
 - [success-race.js](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/d4830f8a5433aaec42252d6ec2c42bb3), which is a JS function that works just like `Promise.race`, but only resolves once some promise returned _successful_ value
 - [async-pool.js](https://gist.github.com/teidesu/537c14805634fbfcd42ae48da45307f1), which is a JS function that works similarly to `Promise.all`, but works with iterators and supports concurrency limits 

#### As well as some closed-source for private use
 - `alice-tts.js`, which is a script that (ab)uses Yandex SpeechKit through Yandex Alice
 - `create-fcm-token.js`, which is a script for creating valid FCM tokens for Android apps from JS code
 - `fcm.js`, which is a script that connects to Google FCM and receives push messages just like a normal Android device
 - `widevine-js`, which is a library that (not perfectly, but still) decrypts [WideVine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widevine)-protected content
 - `obfs.io-deobf.js`, which is a script that deobfuscates (most of) code obfuscated using [obfuscator.io](https://obfuscator.io/)
