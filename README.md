- Currently exploring AI & ML, WebGL and VR

### My projects
#### Most of my time I currently spend working on
 - [PlaShiki](//github.com/plashiki), which is an open-source anime video aggregator
 - and nothing else at the moment.

#### I also made these open-source thingies
 - [protoflex](//github.com/teidesu/protoflex), which is a JS tool for parsing and building arbitrary [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) messages.
 - [vk-audio](//gist.github.com/teidesu/09ff9fe13814f3cd1fe93203447890d9), which is a JS script that produces [VK](//vk.com) tokens valid for usage with restricted `audio.*` API methods
 - [ym_recognition](//gist.github.com/teidesu/7ddf9e0fd89872b09d28d8f59077f2b1), which is a Python script that (ab)uses Yandex Alice to recognize music (poor man's Shazam)

#### As well as some closed-source for private use
 - `alice-tts.js`, which is a script that (ab)uses Yandex SpeechKit through Yandex Alice
 - `create-fcm-token.js`, which is a script for creating valid FCM tokens for Android apps from JS code
 - `fcm.js`, which is a script that connects to Google FCM and receives push messages just like a normal Android device
 - `widevine-js`, which is a library that (not perfectly, but still) decrypts [WideVine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widevine)-protected content
 - `obfs.io-deobf.js`, which is a script that deobfuscates (most of) code obfuscated using [obfuscator.io](https://obfuscator.io/)
